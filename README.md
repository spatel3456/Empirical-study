# Empirical-study
This is a "public" set project with only the description of the acutal "Empirical study" project, which is set "private".

This repository is a dump for all the files/programs that I and a team made as part of the Aggie Research Scholars Program. In the program, we were the CSCE's software engineering team, and we looked at coding practicies and their standings against eachother. Standings were calculate using multiple mediums including readability, survey records and interpretability. 

The project mostly facilitated the study that quantified the above metrics using a survey among CSCE undergraduates at TAMU. Practicies included naming the objects, extensive commenting, and auto generated commenting using an online comment generator. 

You can access the findings by reading our paper (recently accepted at a conference for ACM) or contact me through my email (link can by found through my website).
